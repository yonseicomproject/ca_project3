Problem 1 (Cache Simulation)
Get the following benchmarks among MiBench benchmarks, and perform cache simulation with gem5 for those benchmarks.
 - basicmath_small
 - dijkstra_small (with input.dat)
 - sha (with input_large.asc)
(a) For config 1 ~ 4, do cache simulation with given benchmarks and submit files which is produced from simulation.
(b)Modify gem5 configuration to use random replacement policy. For config 5 ~ 8, do cache simulation with given benchmarks and submit files which is produced from simulation.

Extra 1)
Read paper Aamer Jaleel, Kevin B. Theobald, Simon C. Steely, Jr., and Joel Emer. 2010. High performance cache replacement using re-reference interval prediction (RRIP). SIGARCH Comput. Archit. News 38, 3 (June 2010), 60-71. DOI=http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1816038.1815971, then implement SRRIP policy in gem5 as srrip.hh and srrip.cc. For config 9 ~ 12, do cache simulation with given benchmarks and submit files which is produced from simulation.



Problem 2 (Finding Best Cache Configuration)
Based on simulation statistics, what is the best configuration among config 1~8 for each benchmarks? Write your detailed answer and explanation on report.xxx
